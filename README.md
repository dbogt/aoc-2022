## Background on Challenge
Text below is a direct copy paste of post I made on LinkedIn on Dec 1:

Just a couple more days until December - which means the Holidays are just around the corner but also one of my favourite programming challenges is starting soon: Advent of Code https://adventofcode.com/.

One common question from past participants from our Python and VBA classes at The Marquee Group is how to get better at coding and think with a "compsci" mindset in solving problems. This challenge is probably one of the best ways to learn some neat tricks with Python and also push yourself to explore some more advanced functions in numpy, Pandas and other packages.

This year my colleagues Toze Francisco, CFA, AFM, CFM, Jamie Wilkie, CFA, AFM and myself (the three of us teach our Data Science courses at Marquee) have partnered up and created a private leaderboard and slack channel to discuss each daily challenge. Some of our past Python class participants have already joined us and we are now opening the group to anyone who is interested in continuing their Python learning (you don't have to be a past Marquee participant).

If you would like to join us, please see details below and send me a direct message or comment below if you would like to get added to the discussion group and leaderboard.

*Details on Advent of Code*
- the coding challenge has been organized by Eric Wastl (http://was.tl/) every December since 2015
- each day starting December 1 until Dec 24, a new puzzle will get released at midnight EST; the puzzles have 2 parts, an easy one earning you a "silver star" and a more difficult one earning a "gold star"
- there is technically no time limit to complete the puzzle, but you need to complete the previous day's challenges to get access to the next puzzle
- each year there is usually a fun story that connects the puzzles (e.g. saving Santa from the bottom of the ocean, etc.)
- the challenge itself doesn't have any prizes, except for "bragging rights", but there will be a prize to the top non-Marquee person in our leaderboard; more details will be in the private slack
- the challenges are technically program agnostic (you can solve them with python, c++, java, vba, even Excel for some of the days), but we'll be posting the Python hints/solutions in our slack channel
- you don't need to be a programming expert to solve the questions, but knowledge of basic programming concepts is recommended (e.g. looping, if statements, functions)

*Details on Joining our Leaderboard*
